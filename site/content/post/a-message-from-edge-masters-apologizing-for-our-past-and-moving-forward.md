We recognize that this policy was discriminatory and hurtful to our snowboarding community. We are truly sorry for the harm that we caused and want to take responsibility for our actions.

We have taken the time to reflect on our past actions and have come to realize that our skiers-only policy was not in line with our core values of inclusivity and community building. We understand that the sport of skiing and snowboarding are closely related and that many of our members may enjoy both activities.

We have decided to change our policy and welcome all skiers and snowboarders to join Edge Masters. We are committed to creating a safe and inclusive space for all members of our community, regardless of their chosen method of sliding on snow.

In addition, we will be taking steps to make amends for our past actions. We will be reaching out to our snowboarding community to listen to their concerns and feedback, and to work together to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for all. We will also be making a donation to a non-profit organization that promotes inclusivity and diversity in the skiing and snowboarding community.

We understand that it will take time and effort to regain the trust of our snowboarding community, and we are committed to doing the work necessary to make things right. We hope that our members, both current and future, can see that we are taking this issue seriously and that we are committed to creating a better and more inclusive community for all.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

Sincerely, The Edge Masters Team
