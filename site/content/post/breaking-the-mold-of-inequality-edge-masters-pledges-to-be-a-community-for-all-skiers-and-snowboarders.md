Our team has always been dedicated to providing the best possible skiing experience and we believe that everyone should have access to our top-notch edge maintenance techniques, no matter the cost. 

That is why we are proud to announce that, effective immediately, all membership tiers cost **$0**. That's right, our Silver, Gold, and Platinum memberships are now [completely free](/products/)!

We believe that everyone should have equal access to the benefits and resources that Edge Masters has to offer, *regardless of their ability to pay*.

Additionally, we are thrilled to have [a "Join" button](/products/) on our website, making it easier than ever for individuals to become part of the Edge Masters community. We are dedicated to creating a space where all skiers and snowboarders can come together to improve their skills, share their experiences, and push the limits of what is possible on the slopes.

> I recently joined Edge Masters and I couldn't be happier with my experience! As a snowboarder, I was initially hesitant about joining an organization that once only welcomed skiers. However, after seeing their commitment to inclusivity and their recent changes to make membership free for all, I knew I had to give it a try. And boy, am I glad I did! The community of skiers and snowboarders is warm and welcoming, and the resources they provide for maintaining and improving my edge have been a game-changer. Thanks Edge Masters!
