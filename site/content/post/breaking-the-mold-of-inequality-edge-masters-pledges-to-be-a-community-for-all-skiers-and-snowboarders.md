Our team has always been dedicated to providing the best possible skiing experience and we believe that everyone should have access to our top-notch edge maintenance techniques, no matter the cost. 

That is why we are proud to announce that, effective immediately, all membership tiers cost **$0**. That's right, our Silver, Gold, and Platinum memberships are now [completely free](/products/)!

We believe that everyone should have equal access to the benefits and resources that Edge Masters has to offer, *regardless of their ability to pay*.

Additionally, we are thrilled to have [a "Join" button](/products/) on our website, making it easier than ever for individuals to become part of the Edge Masters community. We are dedicated to creating a space where all skiers and snowboarders can come together to improve their skills, share their experiences, and push the limits of what is possible on the slopes.

We apologize to anyone who may have been hurt by our past policies and we promise to do better moving forward. We hope that this new direction will demonstrate our commitment to creating an inclusive and equitable community for all.
