In the small ski town of Hakuba, high school student Ayaka is an up-and-coming skier. She spends her days practicing on the slopes and her evenings sharpening her skis, or "edging" them to perfection.

But when Ayaka's coach is found dead at the bottom of a ski lift, Ayaka is determined to uncover the truth. She enlists the help of her eccentric friend, Kana, and together they begin to unravel the mystery.

As they dig deeper, they discover that the coach's death was not an accident and that a sinister organization known as the "Edge Masters" may be behind it. The Edge Masters are a group of ski enthusiasts who believe that the only way to truly excel at skiing is to have the sharpest edges on their skis, no matter the cost.

Despite the danger, Ayaka and Kana continue to investigate, but they soon realize that they are not the only ones on the trail of the Edge Masters. A mysterious skier in all black, who goes by the name of "God," is also after them.

As Ayaka and Kana race to uncover the truth, they must also avoid God and the Edge Masters, who will stop at nothing to silence them. In a shocking twist, Ayaka and Kana discover that God is actually Ayaka's own father, who has been manipulating her and Kana the entire time.

In the climactic finale, Ayaka confronts her father and the Edge Masters, determined to put an end to their evil plan. In a fit of rage, she kills her father, realizing that adults are not to be trusted and that she must rely on her own strength and skill to succeed in the world of skiing.

As the snow falls, Ayaka stands victorious, her skis gleaming with sharp edges, ready to take on any challenge that comes her way.
