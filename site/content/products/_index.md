testimonials:
  - author: Big Ginger King
    quote: I reached out to Edge Masters about joining the group, but I never heard
      back from them. I sent an email and left a message on the phone, but never
      received a response. I was really excited about the idea of being part of
      a group that values edge maintenance, but their lack of communication was
      a huge disappointment. I hope they can improve their customer service in
      the future.

    quote: As a skier, I have found that Edge Masters offers a great service for
      maintaining and sharpening my ski edges. The staff is knowledgeable and
      efficient, and I have always been satisfied with the results. However, I
      do understand the concerns about their previous policy towards
      snowboarders and am glad to see that they have recognized and addressed
      those issues. Overall, I have had a positive experience with Edge Masters
      and would recommend them to other skiers.
  - quote: I never thought I'd be a fan of a ski maintenance group, but Edge Masters
      has changed my tune. Not only do they keep my skis in top shape, but they
      also provide me with the freshest memes. My social media game has never
      been stronger! Just like my skis, my memes are always on the bleeding edge
      thanks to Edge Masters.

  - quote: I was sold by the testimonies and Edge Masters commitment to fairness and
      equality. I, too, like sharp edging and equality. I couldn’t pass up this
      opportunity and decided to join today!
