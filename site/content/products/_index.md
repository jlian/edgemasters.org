testimonials:
  - author: Big Ginger King
    quote: I reached out to Edge Masters about joining the group, but I never heard
      back from them. I sent an email and left a message on the phone, but never
      received a response. I was really excited about the idea of being part of
      a group that values edge maintenance, but their lack of communication was
      a huge disappointment. I hope they can improve their customer service in
      the future.

    quote: Since joining Edge Masters, I've seen a noticeable improvement in my
      skiing. The attention to detail and commitment to edge sharpness is
      impressive. Not only that, but the community aspect is fantastic. It's
      great to be part of a group where everyone is passionate about skiing and
      wants to push themselves to be better. I'm looking forward to skiing with
      Edge Masters for many years to come.
